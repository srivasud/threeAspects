# Making of visualization for the Mayor of the City of Chicago.

[Children's Safety Zone Program & Automated Speed Enforcement:](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdot/supp_info/children_s_safetyzoneporgramautomaticspeedenforcement.html)

Chicago experiences roughly 3,000 crashes annually between motor vehicles and pedestrians, about 800 of which involve children.The City of Chicago stared enforcing automated speed violations around the children's Safety Zone from Q3-2014. I have downloaded the speed violations data for the City of Chicago from the City of Chicago website [Source]:(https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Speed-Camera-Violations/hhkd-xvj4) which contains speed violations from Q3-2014 to Q1-2019.

I prepared a presentation of a visual containing three aspects namely interesting story from the data, non-trivial information and unexpected story from the data. The below is the link of the Data Visual Presentation to the Mayor [Visual Presentation:](https://public.tableau.com/profile/srinivasan.vasudevan#!/vizhome/InduvidualProject-ThreeAspects/ThreeAspects)

I will dive in to the "making of" this visual.
