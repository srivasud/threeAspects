# "Making of" Data Visualization for the Mayor of The City of Chicago.

Chicago experiences roughly 3,000 crashes annually between motor vehicles and pedestrians, about 800 of which involve children.The City of Chicago stared enforcing automated speed violations around the children's Safety Zone from Q3-2014 [Source](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdot/supp_info/children_s_safetyzoneporgramautomaticspeedenforcement.html)

I have downloaded the speed violations data of the City of Chicago from the City website [Source](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Speed-Camera-Violations/hhkd-xvj4) which contains speed violations from Q3-2014 to Q1-2019.

I prepared a Visualization presentation explaining the three aspects namely interesting story from the data, non-trivial information and unexpected story from the data for the Mayor of the City of Chicago.

I will dive in to the "making of" this visualization.

The first aspect is telling a interesting story from the data.
